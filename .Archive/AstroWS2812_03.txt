### Arduino LED Clock with Sunrise/Sunset Tracking

This Arduino code creates a 24-hour clock visualization using an LED strip (332 LEDs). It:

1. Fetches sunrise, sunset, and solar noon times daily from the sunrise-sunset.org API
2. Maps the 24-hour day across the LED strip
3. Shows current time as a yellow LED
4. Displays daylight hours with very dim blue LEDs
5. Keeps solar noon LED off
6. Calculates LED positions using seconds-per-LED ratio (24hrs/332 LEDs)
7. Includes serial debugging output for time and LED positions

Key features:
- Updates sun data once per day
- Uses real-world astronomical data
- Safety checks for LED array bounds
- UTC/local time handling
