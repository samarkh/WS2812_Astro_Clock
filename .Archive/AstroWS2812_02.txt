### Arduino LED Clock with Sunrise/Sunset Tracking

1-15: Includes required libraries and defines LED strip configuration (332 LEDs, Pin 48)
16-24: WiFi and NTP server configuration
25-26: Location coordinates for sunrise/sunset calculation
27-38: SunriseSunset struct and LED array definition
40-71: getSunriseSunset() function - fetches sunrise/sunset times from API
73-88: setup() - initializes LED strip, WiFi, and time synchronization

90-155: loop() function:
  - 91-96: Declares static variables for time tracking
  - 93-97: Fetches sunrise/sunset times every 6 hours
  - 97-102: Updates sunrise/sunset times hourly
  - 104-109: Gets current time
  - 111-114: Calculates current LED position
  - 116-120: Calculates sunrise/sunset LED positions
  - 122-127: Prints debug information
  - 129-148: LED control logic:
    - Illuminates LEDs from sunrise to current position in blue
    - Marks current position in yellow
    - Illuminates remaining LEDs to sunset in blue
  - 150-152: Updates LED strip and delays 1 second
